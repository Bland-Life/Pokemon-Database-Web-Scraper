# Pokemon Database Web Scraper
## About
A python script that's meant to scrape some simple information about each pokemon stored on https://pokemondb.net/. The information scraped from the website 
can then be stored within a CSV or JSON file. 

## Project Review
A personal project where I challenged myself to collect and clean data that I had scraped from a website. I chose to collect data from related to a 
video game franchise I enjoy, Pokemon, a game about collecting and battling with monsters. I collected the names and some simple information about 
each monster. 

Unlike my first project on this repository, the Tic Tac Toe project, where the true difficulty of the project came to me in the later stages of development, 
this project proved difficult right from the beginning. Originally I had chosen to scrape information from another website that hosted the information I needed, 
Bulbapedia, but I found the layout of the HTML too difficult to navigate and scrape what info I needed, eventually settling on Pokemon Database and it's simpler, 
more organized layout. 

If I were to start the project again I believe I'd start by scouting out a few websites that host the information I need and only then choosing one to scrape my data from. 
I wasted a lot of time trying to make my code work with a more difficult website layout, when in fact there were easier options.
